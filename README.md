# Hate-Speech-Detection-using-ML
This repository contains code and resources for detecting hate speech using machine learning techniques. The dataset
used includes tweets labeled as hate speech, offensive language, and non-hate speech.
## Overview
The project focuses on implementing logistic regression for hate speech detection using a Twitter dataset. The goal is to develop an accurate and efficient algorithm that can identify hate speech and offensive language in social media content.
## Key Features

- Preprocessing techniques for cleaning and tokenizing Twitter data.
- Implementation of logistic regression algorithm for hate speech detection.
- Perfectly balancing the dataset.
- Evaluation metrics for assessing model performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  ## Result
- By using logistic regression, we have achieved an accuracy of 93% (approx)
- We can also test it by giving a custom input
